# GPIBprologix
Very simple GPIB driver for Prologix USB-GPIB adapter

<br>I made this Library to support a Chinese copy of a Prologix USB-GPIB adapter i bought that was made to support Prologix.
<br>I also designed it to be as easy as PyVisa so it uses the same names for It's defines, classes and such
<br>Supports multiple GPIB instruments on a single USB-GPIB adapter.
